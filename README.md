# Weapon DPS Statistical Simulator

This project is an ambitious attempt to create an accurate damage calculator for
the video game Warframe. While other [similar calculators](https://overframe.gg)
exist, I feel they are strongly lacking in a series of primary features I
appreciate:

-   They have bugs that hinder simple computations, or otherwise don't implement
    simple features that are useful (e.g. Cascadia Flare);
-   They don't simulate status effects, making the computed results extremely
    biased;
-   They do not simulate different environments that are more realistic, opting
    to simplify the computation whenever needed in favor of a quick (but more
    worthless) user experience.

This project aims to solve all of these issues while providing a (code-first!)
implementation.
